#  Custom hostname, solving that iOS >= 17 no longer provides hostname
#  to Apps.
#
#  Two modes of operation
#
#  1)  Working around regular iSH inability to use /etc/hostname, simple
#      setup like traditional Linux, set the hostname once for a Device
#      and unless you touch it all is good.
#      To select this mode give /etc/hostname as sourcefile.
#      This will skip any syncing, just displaying what is in /etc/hostname
#
#  2)  Using a source file, fed by an iOS Shortcut tied to the iSH App starting,
#      then writing curent hostname to last line of this source file.
#      This will automatically propagate to all iOS devices using the
#      same AppleId, so a bit of a task to setup, but once done it will
#      spread to all your devices and update iSH to whatever is the
#      hostname when the app starts
#      To select this mode give any filename other than /etc/hostname
#      as sourcefile. For this to work this must be the same iOS filename
#      as you use in the iOS shortcut

hostname version able to pick up hostname via syncfile.
This automates hostname allocation if you run iSH on multiple devices,
or run both iSH and iSH-AOK on the same device.

If $f_hostname_aok_suffix is present,
instances running the kernel iSH-AOK will be given the suffix -aok to
their hostname, unless alrady present.

To see an example of how to create the shortcut needed that feeds this
check https://github.com/jaclu/AOK-Filesystem-Tools/Docs/hostname-shortcut.md

Available options:

-h  --help         Print this help and exit

Custom options for this hostname implementation:

-S  --sourcefile   Defines where to pickup hostname. Unless this is
                   $f_etc_hostname,the last line of this file will be used
                   when doing: -U / --update
                   If it is $f_etc_hostname, hostname is asumed to be
                   static. Current source file:
                     $(get_sync_file_fn)

-U  --update       If source file is not /etc/hosts - re-read sourcefile.
                   Last line of this file will be copied to /etc/hosts
                   and used as hostname.
                   If kernel is iSH-AOK, and the file:
                     $f_hostname_aok_suffix
                   is present, -aok will be added as suffix to hostname,
                   unless already in hostname.
                   Finally the new hostname will be added to /etc/hosts
                   if not already present.

All other options are ignored, for compatibility with the default hostnme"
