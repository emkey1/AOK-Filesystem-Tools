#
# A list of variables used during build and for /usr/local/bin stuff
#

#
#  Label for AOK builds
#
AOK_VERSION="Beta-002"

#
#  Alternatives are: enable disable once
#  This is not yet supported on Debian builds, and will be ignored there
#
INITIAL_LOGIN_MODE="enable"

#
#  ALPINE_VERSION defines what Alpine release will be used
#
# ALPINE_VERSION=3.14.8  # End of Alpine support 2023-05-01
# ALPINE_VERSION=3.15.6  # End of Alpine support 2023-11-01
ALPINE_VERSION=3.16.3 # End of Alpine support 2024-05-23
# ALPINE_VERSION=3.17.1  # End of Alpine support 2024-11-22
# ALPINE_VERSION=edge    # Current development tree

#
#  Please never enable this here. If you want to hard-code timezone,
#  please put this variable with your TZ preference in .AOK_VARS
#  If not hardcoded, /usr/local/bin/set-timezone will be run during
#  setup, allowing user to select timezone.
#
# AOK_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin"

#
#  Use this if you have your own restore procedure.
#  If defined, this will be run after deploy has completed, at a time
#  when it should be running inside a full AOK FS
#  If this is a script, it must be available with this PATH on the new
#  FS, that means it most likely needs to be in the iCloud mount.
#  This one is also better to define in .AOK_VARS
#
# FIRST_BOOT_ADDITIONAL_TASKS="/iCloud/spd/bin/deploy-ish"

#
#  Should normally not be changed! Enabling his will create a limited env
#  missing features and functionality!
#
#  Purpose is to speed up the deploy cycle when testing and improving
#  the build processess on slow devices, by cutting down on deploy heavy
#  usability features
#  Enble by setting this to 1
#  Ideal candidate to modify in .AOK_VARS
#

#  Additional APK groups managed with /usr/local/bin/aok_groups

#  Any variable ending with _APKS in this file, will be seen as a package

#  conveniently than having to open this file and then do cut/paste
#  repeatedly.
#
#  You can add/modify all the groups to your liking.
#  Again, consider using .AOK_VARS
