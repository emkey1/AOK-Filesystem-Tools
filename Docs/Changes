Alpha Series
.1   o Proof of concept
.20  o First public release
        o Added openrc
.30  o Second public test release
        o Added modified networking script to /etc/init.d to allow networking
          to "start" which in turn allows apache2 to start.  Apache2 appears to
          work but I did very minimal testing
        o Added mosh
        o Moved sshd host key generation to enable_sshd where it belongs
        o Added Emmanuel Rouat's bash_profile for ish user, modified it a bit to 
	  work with iSH
        o Added fortune program because I can.  Included it in default 
	  bash_profile
        o Modified /etc/init.d/hostname to always return success so that we can 
          services with dependencies on it
        o Attempted to add both syslog-ng and then rsyslog.  Both cause programs
          that log to wedge.  They run fine under openrc otherwise
	o Added dcron.  Minimal testing at this point.  It starts, runs and 
	  appears to work.  Attempted to use fcron first but it depends on a 
	  working logging system which we don't currently have
	o Added elinks text based web browser to base install
	o Start dcron in enable_sshd.  Which is hacky and sucky but I'm 
	  doing it anyway for now
	o Added the nano editor base install because apparently some people 
	  like it.  <shudder> :-)
.40  o Third public test release
	o copy bash_profile to /root in addition to /home/ish
	o Moved project to github
	o Fixed issue with executable bit not being set on stuff in /usr/local/bin
	  after pull from github
        o Wrote script to build image in chroot enviornment.  It's fairly lame 
	  but works.  
	  'chroot_build_image'
	o Added fake /etc/network/interfaces file to hopefully make 
	  /etc/init.d/networking a bit happier
	o Found apparent bug in BusyBox chroot in regards to soft links made by 
	  apk's during install.  Worked around vi build script
	o I now leave a copy of the AOK build environment in /AOK on the root 
	  image.  You can 
		+ sudo bash
		+ cd /AOK
		+ ./chroot_build_image
		+ You will now have an identical root image in /tmp/AOK 
		  (Assuming you made no changes)
.50  o Fourth public release.  I need to spell check this
	o Added zsh to core RPM's
	o Started to implement VARS file in image builds
	o Create wrapper for /bin/login to assure that the ish user always logs 
	  in initially.  Alas /bin/login doesn't work as expected.  
	o Switched ish user to zsh
	o Switched ish user back to bash, zsh is too slow but still available
	o Login is now required.  With password set it is possible to login 
	  directly as root.  With no password set for ish it logs in fine though
	o busybox vi renamed to vi.real, vim hard linked to vi.  IE, vim is 
	  invoked when vi is typed
.55   o Fifth public test release
	 o Added coreutils apk, which replaces many of the busybox versions of 
	   binaries including df and tar
         o Found fix for timezone issue.  Currently it requires eitehr a custom 
	   tzdata apk or copying a fixed version of the database stuff during the 
	   build.  This is fixed in the Edge version of Alpine.
	 o General cleanup in prep for put to github
	 o Added /usr/local/bin/fix_tz in case the tz files get broken again
	 o The /etc/profile is now much smarter about what it outputs
	 o Changed roots shell to bash
.60   o Fifith public release
         o Added tmux-doc apk
	 o Converted login wrapper to prompt foe login on exit, just like a 
	   "real" linux system
	 o Added fancy tmux configuration file
	 o Modified /etc/profile PATH to put /usr/local/bin first
	 o Changed VARS file to be AOK_VARS and now copy it to /usr/local/etc
	   for use by scripts in /usrlocal/bin
         o Added findutils & findutils-doc to APK's available at first boot
	 o Changed my mind on how to do vim.  It is now linked to 
	   /usr/local/bin/vi and /usr/bin/vi is still busybox vi.  Since 
	   /usr/local/bin appears first in the default path I get what I
	   want and don't screw up the /usr/bin/vi link
         o Addeed the tar, ncurses, ncurses-doc APK to core list
	 o Fixed issue with wrapping in bash with default .bash_profile
         o Alpine up to date as of 27 November 2020
.66   o Another brick in the wall
         o Added binary to show IP of iDevice (idev_ip) and redid the
	   myip script to show both the "Internet IP" and the Local IP
         o Rewrote the showip/myip script to show both the external and 
	   and local IP address.  Uses idev_ip for local
         o Created script to enable vnc (enable_vnc), disable vnc (disable_vnc) and 
           run vnc (vnc_start)
         o Added the 'file' APK.  Not sure why I waited this long
         o Added the 'less' APK.  
         o .bash_profile for both ish and root is now also linked to .bashrc
.70   o Time to provide upgrade path
         o Fixed stale lock 'bug' with vnc_start
	 o Added apt wrapper in previous release, documenting here.  It just
	   gives some info on basic apk commands
         o Added two scripts to start tmux and open panes.  'ipad_tmux' and 
	   'iphone_tmux'
         o Started work on a backup and restore setup to make upgrades easier
           Deferred until next release
         o Removed apache from bloat level 3
	 o Added sed, sed-doc, gawk and gawk-doc, tar-doc to base install
	 o fixed login_loop.c and login_single.c to suck much less
.85   Still no upgrade path.  Next time hopefully.  Some hooks added to 
      make this more doable
	o Modify sshd_config to disable auto logout (I hate that this isn't 
          the default)
        o Enhance bloat to have more verbose usage instructions and a special
          option for packages that don't currently work with ish
        o Rename rbg to runbg, add openrc init script for it and start there 
	  rather than from /etc/profile
        o It looks like the timezone hack is no longer needed.  Removed it and 
          added tzdata and tzdata-doc to standard list of apk's
        o Added a modified /etc/init.d/hwdrivers to fix issues with various 
          OpenRC service startups complaining about service dev not existing.  
          This is likely the wrong approach.  
        o Create /etc/FIRSTBOOT on image generation.  
           o Added section to /etc/profile that checks to see if it exists.  
             If so then there is a section of the script that does stuff that 
             only needs to happen once.  I've moved the removal and creation 
             of /dev/null there since it is certainly broken initially and thus 
             needs to be recreated.
	   o /etc/FIRSTBOOT is removed at the end of the section so that 
             section of only runs the first time
        o The "real" login binary is now being renamed to login.alpine rather 
	  than login.real.  Also renamed login_single to login.once and 
	  login_loop to login.loop
        o Removed all doc (dcron-doc for instance) APK's from initial image to 
	  reduce size.  They can be install with 'bloat docs'
	o Created 'aok' script to manipulate various things about the AOK boot 
	  image.  For now it can be used to change startup behaviour.  
	  'aok -p login' for more info
        o Create /etc/aok_release with the version of AOK used by the boot 
	  image
        o login.loop and login.once now read /etc/aok_release and include 
	  version in login prompt
.85.1   Bug Fix Release
        o Added linux-headers apk to the bloat 1 install
	o Fixed the iCloud script
	o Changed chroot_build_image to write stuff to /iCloud
	o Updated AOK_VARS to reflect new version
        o Moved strace stuff in bloat from bloat level 1 to the aok group
	o Fixed typo in aok usage() and updated boilerplate text to be mildly descriptive
	o Change the ish user to be uid 501
	o Fix 'aok' script usage info to reflect 'once' rather that single for 
	  the exit on exit option
	o Fix bloat package options to be a bit cleaner
.85.2   More Bug fixes
        o Shorten welcome message in login* binaries to fit on iPhone screen
          by removing the word 'root'
.85.3   Tweaks
        o Added cmake to 'bloat 1', added -doc files for 'bloat aok'
        o Now using @jaclu's bgrun script rather than runbg (https://github.com/jaclu/spd/blob/main/files/bgrun)
.85.4	Tweaks
	o For iSH-AOK I added procps and htop to the root fs.  This "fixes" and issue
          in the busybox uptime command that causes bogus uptime to be reported.  To 
          be clear, it dosn't fix busybox itself but rather replaces the uptime command
          from busybox with the one from procps.  Adding htop because it is nice and I 
          wanted to.  Note that neither works on mainline iSH as of the time this note
          was written
.89     Back to Alpine 3.12.1
        o Alpine 3.12.1 is old, but it's reasonably stable in general and specifically so with iSH
.90     Cleanup/Alpine Update
	o Removed a bunch of stuff from /AOK that shouldn't have been there
        o Switched to Alpine 3.12.9
        o /usr/local/bin/installed script now sorts output first
.95	Assorted changes
	o Moved to Alpine 3.12.10
	o /etc/profile now does the right thing if running on iSH verses iSH-AOK
	o Added mc and elock scripts to /usr/local to change and check status of Multicore and extralocking settings 
          in /proc/ish/defaults
        o Added /usr/local/bin/dmesg wrapper to wrap iSH-AOK dmesg output and make it look sane
.96	Assorted changes
        o mc now shows status at the bottom of output when no options are provided
        o Added neofetch to bloat level 3
	o Added jaclu's post_boot.sh to inittab
        o Added simple pbcopy (copy stuff to clipboard) script
.97	Assorted changes
	o mc name changed to toggle_multicore
	o Various refinements and fixes
