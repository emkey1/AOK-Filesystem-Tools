Alpha Series
.1   o Proof of concept
.20  o First public release
        o Added openrc
.30  o Second public test release
        o Added modified networking script to /etc/init.d to allow networking
          to "start" which in turn allows apache2 to start.  Apache2 appears to
          work but I did very minimal testing
        o Added mosh
        o Moved sshd host key generation to enable_sshd where it belongs
        o Added Emmanuel Rouat's bash_profile for ish user, modified it a bit to 
	  work with iSH
        o Added fortune program because I can.  Included it in default 
	  bash_profile
        o Modified /etc/init.d/hostname to always return success so that we can 
          services with dependencies on it
        o Attempted to add both syslog-ng and then rsyslog.  Both cause programs
          that log to wedge.  They run fine under openrc otherwise
	o Added dcron.  Minimal testing at this point.  It starts, runs and 
	  appears to work.  Attempted to use fcron first but it depends on a 
	  working logging system which we don't currently have
	o Added elinks text based web browser to base install
	o Start dcron in enable_sshd.  Which is hacky and sucky but I'm 
	  doing it anyway for now
	o Added the nano editor base install because apparently some people 
	  like it.  <shudder> :-)
.40  o Third public test release
	o copy bash_profile to /root in addition to /home/ish
	o Moved project to github
	o Fixed issue with executable bit not being set on stuff in /usr/local/bin
	  after pull from github
        o Wrote script to build image in chroot enviornment.  It's fairly lame 
	  but works.  
	  'chroot_build_image'
	o Added fake /etc/network/interfaces file to hopefully make 
	  /etc/init.d/networking a bit happier
	o Found apparent bug in BusyBox chroot in regards to soft links made by 
	  apk's during install.  Worked around vi build script
	o I now leave a copy of the AOK build environment in /AOK on the root 
	  image.  You can 
		+ sudo bash
		+ cd /AOK
		+ ./chroot_build_image
		+ You will now have an identical root image in /tmp/AOK 
		  (Assuming you made no changes)
.50  o Fourth public release.  I need to spell check this
	o Added zsh to core RPM's
	o Started to implement VARS file in image builds
	o Create wrapper for /bin/login to assure that the ish user always logs 
	  in initially.  Alas /bin/login doesn't work as expected.  
	o Switched ish user to zsh
	o Switched ish user back to bash, zsh is too slow but still available
	o Login is now required.  With password set it is possible to login 
	  directly as root.  With no password set for ish it logs in fine though
	o busybox vi renamed to vi.real, vim hard linked to vi.  IE, vim is 
	  invoked when vi is typed
.55   o Fifth public test release
	 o Added coreutils apk, which replaces many of the busybox versions of 
	   binaries including df and tar
         o Found fix for timezone issue.  Currently it requires eitehr a custom 
	   tzdata apk or copying a fixed version of the database stuff during the 
	   build.  This is fixed in the Edge version of Alpine.
	 o General cleanup in prep for put to github
	 o Added /usr/local/bin/fix_tz in case the tz files get broken again
	 o The /etc/profile is now much smarter about what it outputs
	 o Changed roots shell to bash
.60   o Fifith public release
         o Added tmux-doc apk
	 o Converted login wrapper to prompt foe login on exit, just like a 
	   "real" linux system
	 o Added fancy tmux configuration file
	 o Modified /etc/profile PATH to put /usr/local/bin first
	 o Changed VARS file to be AOK_VARS and now copy it to /usr/local/etc
	   for use by scripts in /usrlocal/bin
         o Added findutils & findutils-doc to APK's available at first boot
	 o Changed my mind on how to do vim.  It is now linked to 
	   /usr/local/bin/vi and /usr/bin/vi is still busybox vi.  Since 
	   /usr/local/bin appears first in the default path I get what I
	   want and don't screw up the /usr/bin/vi link
         o Addeed the tar, ncurses, ncurses-doc APK to core list
	 o Fixed issue with wrapping in bash with default .bash_profile
         o Alpine up to date as of 27 November 2020
.66   o Another brick in the wall
         o Added binary to show IP of iDevice (idev_ip) and redid the
	   myip script to show both the "Internet IP" and the Local IP
         o Rewrote the showip/myip script to show both the external and 
	   and local IP address.  Uses idev_ip for local
         o Created script to enable vnc (enable_vnc), disable vnc (disable_vnc) and 
           run vnc (vnc_start)
         o Added the 'file' APK.  Not sure why I waited this long
         o Added the 'less' APK.  
         o .bash_profile for both ish and root is now also linked to .bashrc
.70   o Time to provide upgrade path
         o Fixed stale lock 'bug' with vnc_start
         o Image will now include a /iCloud directory and encourage people
           to mount it via a 'iCloud' script
	 o Added apt wrapper in previous release, documenting here.  It just
	   gives some info on basic apk commands
         o Added two scripts to start tmux and open panes.  'ipad_tmux' and 
	   'iphone_tmux'
         o Started work on a backup and restore setup to make upgrades easier
